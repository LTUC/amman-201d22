### For Those Who Have Not Completed Code 102

These assignments are helpful for those who have not completed Code 102 but are still helpful if you have taken Code 102 and would like some review.

- Brush up on Algebra *(1-2 hours)*

  - [http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/index.html](http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/index.html)
  - You don't need to read through each topic, but you should have familiarity with most of them.
  - These kinds of logical and mathematical concepts will be very useful to you as you dig into writing code.

- Practice the Terminal *(1-2 hours)*

  - [https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial)
  - Please work through Sections 1 through 5 of this tutorial. Note: This tutorial is for everyone, even though the word "Linux" is in the title! The same commands work in Windows and MacOS terminals as well.

- Git tutorials *(1-2 hours)*

  - [https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide)

    - There is a lot of useful information in the Udemy tutorial, but it is a lot to digest for beginners. Skim through it as you can while striving to acquire terminology and gaining an understanding of the large concepts. Learning about version control is one of the most challenging things in the first week of Code 201. Above all, for now, strive for a conceptual understanding of how version control works, and why we use it in software development. The details are much more easy to grasp once the concepts are in place.
